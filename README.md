# Accelerometer-Classification
Here is the code for a project that I completed in my Neural Networks class at NC State. The goal of this project is to classify someone's walking cadence based on accelerometer data. In baseline.py, a simple baseline model based on pre-extracted features is used.

Note: `fncs.py` and all data was provided by our instructor, with credit being attributed to the [NCSU AROS lab](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/).
